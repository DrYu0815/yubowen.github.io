# Bowen Yu

I'm a first-year Ph.D. student at the [School of Data Science](https://www.ds.cityu.edu.hk/) at [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/zh-cn). I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Xiangyu Zhao](https://zhaoxyai.github.io/). I obtained my Master's degree from CityU and my Bachelor's degree from [Nantong University](https://www.ntu.edu.cn/).

My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, signal processing, and robotics, with a focus on developing innovative solutions for real-world challenges. I have a strong foundation in both hardware and software, with hands-on experience in circuit design, control systems, and data analysis.
